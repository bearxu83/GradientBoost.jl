# Contributing Guidelines

Bug issues + fixes are always welcome! 

If you are interested in building a new feature, please contact me first so we
can iron out any design inconsistencies. =)

Coding Guideline:

* Follow the existing code style.
* Test code.
* Use [git-flow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) as the git branching model.
